### A collection of PHP projects

This is just a few of the PHP projects i have been working on lately, these projects are mainly focused on bringing me up to speed with OOP in PHP


1. BasicCalculator - This was a project to practice basic interaction with HTML forms and elements. This took two inputs, added them together and outputted the final result. Checks were also made to make sure inputs were of correct value.
2. BasicClass - This project was used to practice the creation, instanciation and usage of classes in PHP. This included creating the class, importing into another PHP page, instanciating an instance of that class and finally using the classes built in method to output the final result.
3. FileInFileOut - This project was used to practice working with files in PHP. This is done by taking an input, adding that input to a file and then finally output the contents of the file line by line
4. Basic database - This project is to test my skills when it comes to working with a database inside of PHP, this will eventually include full CRUD functionality

All of these projects are also available to view and interact with at https://louisclaridge.me/projects/php
